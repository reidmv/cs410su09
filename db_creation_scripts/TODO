  This is a sort of scratchpad for jotting down things that need to get done
	but are, for whatever reason, being passed by for now. They should probably
	get done eventually.

 o Implement smart default value for order_lineitems.sort_order. The first 
   item entered for a given order should have sort order 0, the second 
	 entered 1, then 2, 3, etc. and so on and so forth. These need not be
	 unique per order, however, as an item which is "split" into two identical
	 items of differing quantity (for when purchasing from two different 
	 suppliers) will have the same sort value as its parent.
 o Implement smart default value for orders.color. The colors should cycle so
   as to minimize the chance of two active orders having the same color; one
   way to do that is to take mod(COUNT(colors), neworder.ordernumber) or 
   somesuch.

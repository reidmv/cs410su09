1. DATABASE Naming Conventions

	Sequences:
	 Sequence names are lowercase, use underscores to deliniate words, and end
	 with the suffix "_seq". Primary key sequences are given the same name as
	 the table appended with the suffix "_pkey_seq".

	Tables:
	 Table names are lowercase, use underscores to deliniate words, are plural,
	 and strive for names that are self-explanatory. In the case of more or less
	 direct parent-child type relationships between tables, the prefix of the 
	 "parent" table is the singlar version of the "child" name. For example, 
	 'order_statuses' is a "parent" to 'orders'. statuses is hereby decreed to 
	 be the correct plural of "status".

	Columns:
	 Column names are lowercase, use underscores to deliniate words, are
	 singular, and strive for names that are self-explanatory. Primary keys are
	 given by the singular version of the table name and appended with "_pkey".
	 When a column is a foreign key it shall be named in the singular for the 
	 table it references, unless such a name would be an SQL keyword. In such a
	 case "_pkey" shall be appended to the column name.
